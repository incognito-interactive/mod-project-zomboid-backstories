description=Backstories is an immersive and dynamic mod for Project Zomboid that enhances your survival experience by assigning specific starting locations and item loadouts based on your character's occupation. Each occupation, ranging from doctors and police officers to carpenters and chefs, determines your initial location within the game world, reflecting your pre-apocalypse workplace or residence. Moreover, the mod introduces a unique system where the number of zombies you've killed dynamically increases based on the days since the start of the apocalypse, taking into account your character's traits and occupation, thus shaping your character's progression. Embrace the role of your profession, adapt to your surroundings, and craft your own tale of survival against the relentless undead.
